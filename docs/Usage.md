# Author Notes

* All Testing is currently done in Proxmox LXC, Ubuntu 20.04, Python 3.8


# Prerequisites

* A Linux or Mac "Server". Windows currently does not work. A "Server" is a computer that is typically always online.
* Python 3.7 or later.
* Consult [This Page](Origin.md) for additional setup specific to this variant of fHDHR.


# Optional Prerequisites
* If you intend to use Docker, [This Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) should help you get started. The author of fHDHR is not a docker user, but will still try to help.

fHDHR uses direct connections with video sources by default. Alternatively, you can install and update the [config](Config.md) accordingly. You will need to make these available to your systems PATH, or manually set their path via the config file.

* ffmpeg
* vlc


# Installation

## Linux

* Download the zip, or git clone
* Navigate into your script directory and run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* Copy the included `config.example.ini` file to a known location. The script will not run without this. There is no default configuration file location. [Modify the configuration file to suit your needs.](Config.md)

* Run with `python3 main.py -c=` and the path to the config file.


## Docker
This portion of the guide assumes you are using a Linux system with both docker and docker-compose installed. This (or some variation thereof) may work on Mac or Windows, but has not been tested.

* this guide assumes we wish to use the `~/fhdhr` directory for our install (you can use whatever directory you like, just make the appropriate changes elsewhere in this guide) and that we are installing for Youtube-IHOPKC support
* run the following commands to clone the repo into `~/fhdhr/fHDHR_Youtube-IHOPKC`
```
cd ~/fhdhr
git clone https://github.com/fHDHR/fHDHR_Youtube-IHOPKC.git
```
* create your config.ini file (as described earlier in this guide) in the `~/fhdhr/fHDHR_Youtube-IHOPKC` directory
* while still in the `~/fhdhr` directory, create the following `docker-compose.yml` file
```
version: '3'

services:
  youtube-ihopkc:
    build: ./fHDHR_Youtube-IHOPKC
    container_name: youtube-ihopkc
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - ./fHDHR_Youtube-IHOPKC/config.ini:/app/config/config.ini
```
* run the following command to build and launch the container
```
docker-compose up --build -d youtube-ihopkc
```

After a short period of time (during which docker will build your new fHDHR container), you should now have a working build of fHDHR running inside a docker container.

As the code changes and new versions / bug fixes are released, at any point you can pull the latest version of the code and rebuild your container with the following commands:
```
cd ~/fhdhr/fHDHR_Youtube-IHOPKC
git checkout master
git pull
cd ~/fhdhr
docker-compose up --build -d youtube-ihopkc
```
<hr />

You can also run multiple instances of fHDHR to support additional sources by cloning the appropriate repo into your `~/fhdhr` directory and adding the necessary services to the docker-compose file we created above.

* for example, if we also wanted PlutoTV support, you would clone the PlutoTV repository:
```
cd ~/fhdhr
git clone https://github.com/fHDHR/fHDHR_PlutoTV.git
```
* **NOTE**: if you are running multiple services on the same machine, you must change the port in your config.ini file for each one. For example, if Youtube-IHOPKC was using the default port of 5004, PlutoTV cannot also use that port. You must change the port in your PlutoTV config.ini file to something else (5005, for example).
* add plutotv as a service in your `docker-compose.yml` file
```
version: '3'

services:
  youtube-ihopkc:
    build: ./fHDHR_Youtube-IHOPKC
    container_name: youtube-ihopkc
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - ./fHDHR_Youtube-IHOPKC/config.ini:/app/config/config.ini

  plutotv:
    build: ./fHDHR_PlutoTV
    container_name: plutotv
    network_mode: host
    volumes:
      - ./fHDHR_PlutoTV/config.ini:/app/config/config.ini
```
* run the following command to build and launch the container
```
docker-compose up --build -d plutotv
```

You can repeat these instructions for as many fHDHR containers as your system resources will allow.

# Setup

Now that you have fHDHR running, You can navigate (in a web browser) to the IP:Port from the configuration step above.

If you did not setup a `discovery_address` in your config, SSDP will be disabled. This is not a problem as clients like Plex can have the IP:Port entered manually!

You can copy the xmltv link from the webUI and use that in your client software to provide Channel Guide information.
